This site is a combination of a blog and documentation on projects I am working on. The documentation section is intended as a place for objective guides on things I have done, whereas the blog section if more off-topic and based on my opinion. My intent for this site is three fold: to be a reference for myself, to hopefully help others working on similar projects, and to help me learn topics more efficiently. That being said, I am not an expert on anything. I will try to periodically fix errors as I gain experience, but I cannot guarantee the correctness of anything on this site.
